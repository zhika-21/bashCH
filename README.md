```bash
#!/bin/bash
```
- **Shebang**: This line tells the system that the script should be run using the Bash shell. It's like specifying the interpreter for the script.

```bash
count=0
```
- **Initialization**: A variable `count` is initialized to 0. It will be used to track how many odd numbers have been printed.

```bash
num=1
```
- **Initialization**: A variable `num` is initialized to 1, which is the first odd number. This will be printed and incremented through each iteration of the loop.

```bash
while [ $count -lt 100 ]
```
- **While Loop**: This line starts a `while` loop that runs as long as the value of `count` is less than 100. It ensures that the loop runs exactly 100 times to print the first 100 odd numbers.

```bash
do
```
- **Start of Loop**: This line indicates the start of the loop's body, where the actual printing and counting operations will occur.

```bash
  echo $num
```
- **Print the number**: This line prints the current value of `num` (which starts at 1 and increases by 2 each time). `echo` is used to output the value to the terminal.

```bash
  num=$((num + 2))
```
- **Increment `num`**: After printing, the `num` is incremented by 2. This is done using the arithmetic expansion `$(( ))` to add 2 to the current value of `num`. The new value of `num` will be used in the next iteration.

```bash
  count=$((count + 1))
```
- **Increment `count`**: This line increments `count` by 1 after each iteration. This is necessary to track how many numbers have been printed. When `count` reaches 100, the loop will stop.

```bash
done
```
- **End of Loop**: This marks the end of the `while` loop. Once `count` reaches 100, the loop will exit.

### Summary of flow:
1. `count` starts at 0, and `num` starts at 1.
2. The loop runs 100 times (until `count` becomes 100).
3. Each time through the loop:
   - It prints `num`.
   - Increments `num` by 2 (to get the next odd number).
   - Increments `count` by 1.
4. Once `count` reaches 100, the loop stops.

This will output the first 100 odd numbers, one per line. Let me know if you need further clarifications!
